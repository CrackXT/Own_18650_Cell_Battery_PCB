# Own_18650_Cell_Battery_PCB

PCB files for a 18650 cell mount on a separate board

# Description

Compatible with protected 18650 cell type only!

This is an external battery cell board that allows you to mount the appropriate cell holder (18650) and thus have better connection and mounting options in your project or case.

The board can be produced here (AISLER) with the files (.brd and .sch) or by any other PCB manufacturer. -> https://aisler.net/
