Platzhalter - PCB files for two Adafruit Feather/FeatherWing on one PCB (side by side)

# Description

Platzhalter - Two Feather/FeatherWing can be placed side by side on this board.

Platzhalter - The Doubler 1X2, has a tripple duplicate breakout for each pin on a Feather, as well as a bunch of plain grid development holes. Also, the three sets of pins are cross connected and for GND(- or black) and 3.3V(+ or red), they give you a full strip of connected pads.

Platzhalter - The board can be produced here (AISLER) with the files (.brd and .sch) or by any other PCB manufacturer. -> https://aisler.net/
